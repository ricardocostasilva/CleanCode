# CleanCode

## Introduction
CleanCode is a repository demonstrating best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code using the Swift programming language. The repository features practical examples of MVVM architecture with coordinators, clean code principles, and comprehensive unit testing.

## Features
- **MVVM Architecture**: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel architecture, promoting a clear separation of concerns and enhancing testability.
- **Coordinators**: Uses the coordinator pattern to handle navigation, improving modularity and readability.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Adheres to principles outlined in Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code," including meaningful names, small functions, and avoiding duplication.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure code reliability and correctness, with examples demonstrating testable code structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 12.5 or later
- Swift 5.3 or later

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ricardocostasilva/CleanCode.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open CleanCode/CleanCodeTest.xcodeproj
   ```

### Running the Application
- Select the `CleanCodeTest` scheme.
- Press `Cmd+R` to run the application.

- Can be an issue with the database. delete the one present in the Persistent folder and import it again.

### Running the Tests
- Select the `CleanCodeTest` scheme.
- Press `Cmd+U` to run the tests.

## Best Practices Demonstrated
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with distinct directories for models, views, and controllers.
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
